# Client Module

This module contains `Game.exe` hooks and client-side quality-of-life patches.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or newer
- Visual Studio 2022
- C++23
- Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)
- x86 build target
- Optional runtime `D3DX9_43.dll` beside `Game.exe` or installed system-wide only for the `/font` command (D3DX font picker). All other texture loading (PNG, DDS) uses built-in decoders and does not require D3DX.

## Build

```powershell
..\build-client.cmd
```

The root build script restores the required DirectX SDK package and builds `sdev-client` as Release|x86.

## CONFIG.INI

The client reads several user-facing options from `CONFIG.INI`.

```ini
[ADVANCED]
; 1 skips the updater token check and lets Game.exe launch directly.
; 0 keeps the stock updater-required behavior.
SKIPUPDATER=0

; 1 auto-selects the only available server.
; 0 keeps the stock server-selection screen.
SKIPSERVERSELECTION=1

; 1 skips character mode selection and forces Ultimate Mode.
; 0 keeps the stock mode-selection screen.
SKIPMODESELECTION=1

; 0 uses data/interface.
; 1 redirects the interface folder to data/interfep6 and disables the EP4 HUD layout package.
UI=0

; Empty or missing defaults to 127.0.0.1.
IP=

; Enables or disables the GM/admin ID view patch where supported.
IDVIEW=OFF

; Visual title rendering from cloak data.
TITLES=ON

; Visual colored-name rendering from helmet data.
COLOUR=ON

; Optional visual/performance toggles controlled by chat commands and F7.
COSTUMES=TRUE
PETS=TRUE
WINGS=TRUE
EFFECTS=TRUE
FPS_BOOST=FALSE

[FONT]
; Written by /font. Defaults to Arial 13 normal.
HEIGHT=13
WEIGHT=400
ITALIC=0
FACENAME=Arial
```

## Commands

- `/font` opens the Windows font picker and persists the selected in-game font. It uses the 32-bit `D3DX9_43.dll` runtime when available to `Game.exe`.
- `/effects on` and `/effects off` toggle player and mob effect rendering.
- `/pets on` and `/pets off` toggle pet rendering. This also controls mob effects in the current hook.
- `/wings on` and `/wings off` toggle wing rendering.
- `/costumes on` and `/costumes off` toggle costume rendering.
- `/fpsboost on` and `/fpsboost off` toggle the client FPS boost path.
- `/titles on` and `/titles off` toggle visual item titles at runtime.
- `/colour on` and `/colour off` toggle visual colored names at runtime.
- `/color on` and `/color off` are accepted aliases for `/colour`.

## Stable Client Features

Repository scope reminder: `sdev` is the game server module, and `sdev-client` is the client patch module.

This section is the client-side feature map. Every entry is installed from `Main()` in `src/main.cpp`.

### Startup, Login, And Windowing

- **Updater bypass**: `ADVANCED/SKIPUPDATER=1` injects the same command-line token normally provided by `Updater.exe`, allowing direct `Game.exe` launch without changing the normal startup state machine.
- **Login server override**: `ADVANCED/IP=` rewrites the stock login server string. Empty or missing values keep the default `127.0.0.1`.
- **Login splash skip**: removes the Nexon/copyright splash and shortens the startup waits while preserving required login resource initialization.
- **Single-server skip**: `ADVANCED/SKIPSERVERSELECTION=1` hides the server panel and selects the only available server through the safe delayed stock path.
- **Unicode main HWND**: upgrades the GAME window to a Unicode window and keeps the visible title as `Shaiya`, preventing the legacy title truncation issue.
- **UTF-8 chat input**: accepts composed Unicode/IME text, stores UTF-8 bytes in the stock textbox, fixes multibyte wrapping/rendering branches, and removes the forced byte-127 send terminator.
- **System message dispatch**: provides a private window message used by client code to safely post system messages back through the game UI thread.
- **Welcome message**: posts the existing `SysMsg` welcome entry after the client UI is ready. The message text remains owned by the normal `sysmsg.txt` data.
- **Visual chat tokens**: draws a movable ImGui emoji button near the chat input during gameplay. The button position can be relocated from the picker panel (Move/Reset) and is persisted to `CONFIG.INI`. The picker scans `emojiN.png` entries from internal `Data\Emojis` and `gifN.gif` entries from internal `Data\Gifs` in `data.sah/saf`, then inserts plain chat tokens such as `:emoji1:` or `:gif2:` into the stock textbox through the game UI thread. The picker exposes separate ON/OFF toggles for emojis and GIFs; disabled token families are hidden from native text without drawing an overlay. GIF picker entries use lightweight static previews with a bounded resident cache, while full animation is loaded only when a GIF is rendered in chat/floating text. Packets and server handling remain plain text.

### Character Creation And Selection

- **Mode selection skip**: `ADVANCED/SKIPMODESELECTION=1` bypasses the mode-selection UI and forces Ultimate Mode during character creation.
- **Name gate bypass**: skips local ASCII-only name format checks, legacy blocked-substring checks, the local "name already verified" gate, and the UI availability request. Real validation must be enforced server/dbAgent side.
- **Busy-as-success fallback**: treats one legacy character-creation busy result path as success for compatibility with UTF-8/special-name creation flows.
- **Character select adjustments**: patches select-screen texture/text positions used by the current interface pack.
- **Extended character allocation**: grows `CCharacter` allocation from `0x43C` to `0x444`, initializes custom members, and resets them on character reset.

### Interface And Assets

- **PNG interface redirect**: rewrites known interface `.tga`/`.jpg` references to `.png` at runtime. The redirect is intentionally limited to known UI paths and avoids broad icon conversion.
- **Custom UI folder**: `ADVANCED/UI=1` redirects stock `data/interface` references to `data/interfep6`. `UI=0` or a missing setting keeps `data/interface`.
- **PNG screenshots**: rewrites screenshot filename templates from `.jpg/.JPG` to `.png`.
- **EP4 HUD package**: ports selected EP4 HUD pieces: main stats frame/bars/level, target bar, target buffs/debuffs, map/minimap buttons/background/clock/server time, map arrows, bottom button strips, option main button, and load bar. Includes 15 EXP/Bless bar hooks (position, length, width, text, and glow) across three resolution variants (800, 640, 1024) to fit bars inside the EP4 ornamental frame. Inventory and stock EXP/Bless bars are intentionally not replaced. This package is disabled when `ADVANCED/UI=1` so the `interfep6` layout remains coherent.
- **EP6 clock support**: the EP4 clock uses `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS` 24-hour format. The game-clock format patch is shared by the standard UI and `ADVANCED/UI=1` EP6 interface.
- **Background render arguments**: adjusts startup/login background draw arguments used by the current UI setup.
- **Level-up message suppression**: keeps the stock level-up texture creation flow, but forces the render size to zero so the splash is hidden.
- **GM H-key HP viewer removal**: disables the vanilla redundant GM HP viewer opened by `H`; the custom target viewer remains available.
- **Stats window color patch**: adjusts patched stats-window colors to fit the current interface.
- **Dungeon map visibility**: allows dungeon maps to be shown by the client.
- **PvP rank icon alignment**: adjusts UI image coordinates so PvP rank icons render correctly in both the standard and EP6 interface layouts.

### Raid 150 UI

- Restores five raid page buttons using `RaidButton1.png` through `RaidButton5.png`.
- Redirects party/raid indexing and rendering to the currently selected page, giving access to 150 users as five pages of 30.
- Keeps extra raid labels white for readability.
- Captures mouse messages over the raid page buttons so clicks no longer pass through to the world movement handler.
- Clears the DirectInput left-button state when a raid button is consumed, preventing accidental movement behind the UI.

### Battleground Button

- Draws `main_stats_pvp_button.png` inside the main stats UI without rewriting the whole `CStatusMiniBar` layout.
- When `ADVANCED/UI=1`, the button render position and click hitbox are shifted upward to match the `interfep6` main stats frame.
- Reads `BattleFieldMoveInfo_Client.ini` from the client root or `Data` folder to display the correct battlefield name for the player level.
- Sends packet `0x233` only after the click starts and ends inside the button, avoiding accidental activation during window maximize/minimize.
- Uses a native confirmation dialog before sending the move request.

### Target, Names, Titles, And Text

- **Target HP viewer**: draws current/max HP inside the native target frame for monsters and users, using the configured game font.
- When `ADVANCED/UI=1`, the target HP viewer is shifted upward to match the custom target frame.
- **Item titles**: renders visual titles from cloak data and can be toggled with `TITLES` or `/titles`.
- **Name colors**: renders colored names from helmet data, including rainbow color mode, and can be toggled with `COLOUR` or `/colour`.
- **Font picker**: `/font` updates the GDI font and all known D3DX camera font slots so labels, counters, chat-adjacent overlays, and native text helpers stay consistent.
- **Chat balloon height**: increases chat balloon height from `1.5` to `1.75` for better title/name layouts.
- **Mob/player effect toggles**: command hooks can hide player effects, mob effects, costumes, pets, wings, and related visual objects.

### Items, Equipment, And Packets

- **Custom recreation runes in blacksmith**: allows item effects `220..240` to be placed in the NPC recreation window.
- **Buy/sell quantity limit**: raises the client-side quantity cap from `10` to `255`.
- **Disguise removal fix**: stabilizes the `0x303` packet handler path.
- **Appearance/sex change fix**: stabilizes the `0x226` packet handler path.
- **System message 509 support**: handles the `0x229` message path.
- **Javelin attack fix**: adjusts the `0x502` handler stack/argument layout.
- **Item icon quantities**: draws inventory and quickslot item counts while skipping lapis/firework-style items that should not show counts.
- **Two-hand/off-hand logic**: fixes `CPlayerData::IsTwoHandWeapon` behavior so custom off-hand support can coexist with one-hand weapons.
- **Weapon step display**: patches the client weapon-step path used by lapisian/enchant display.
- **Vehicle packet/display support**: supports vehicle-related EP6.4 shape/list packet fields and client display paths where implemented.

### Quick Slots And Input

- Adds the third quick-slot bar allocation/free/save behavior and routes item, skill, and basic-action movement between quick-slot bags.
- Patches quick-slot plus buttons and interaction paths so the extended bars can be opened and used.
- Removes selected client-side quick-slot delays: skill delay, basic action delay, and the extra `+1000ms` delay gate. The revolver delay patch is intentionally left disabled in code for release stability.
- Holding left click while assigning status points applies `x10` when enough points are available; otherwise it falls back to `+1`.

### Buffs And Movement

- **Movable buff row**: hold `F6` plus left click to save the current buff position to `CONFIG.ini` under `[BUFF] LOCATION_X/LOCATION_Y`.
- **Persistent buff layout**: detours the buff X/Y instructions so the saved location is used every render.
- **Buff spacing/count**: adjusts row spacing and count per row to match the current interface.
- **Fast transition**: shortens selected transition waits to `100ms`.

### Visual Timers And Flow

- **Ress leader timer**: aligns the client popup countdown with the server-side 5 second timer.
- **Logout/game-over timer**: aligns the visible logout countdown with the shortened server logout delay.
- **Subaction sysmsg cooldown**: rate-limits sysmsgs `5228..5237` to one visible message every 20 seconds per player name instead of removing them completely.
- **Experience view fix**: prevents the client from displaying experience values multiplied by ten and ignores locale-specific EXP multiplication where applicable.

### Resolution And Graphics

- Adds `1366x768`, `1400x900`, `2560x1080`, `2560x1440`, `3840x1080`, `3840x2160`, and `3440x1440`.
- Expands option-screen resolution rendering, selection, saving, and apply behavior.
- Reuses stock large-layout positioning branches so UI placement remains stable at wider resolutions.
- Caches gamma/distance/float option values to prevent the expanded resolution table from corrupting option sliders.
- Applies camera limit from the global `g_cameraLimit` value.
- Applies costume, pet, wing, and dungeon shadow/lag workarounds used by the current visual setup.

### Discord And ImGui Panel

- Discord RPC initializes with the static application id/message defined in `src/discord.cpp`.
- `F8` toggles the ImGui roulette panel. The panel is visible to all players, requests the server reward list, displays real item names/icons from the configured server rewards, and sends the server roulette roll packet. Hovering a reward on the wheel shows the item name and description tooltip.
- `F9` toggles the GM debug panel (requires `IsAdmin`). Currently shows a rolling log of recent chat types to help identify upper-bar exclusions. The panel code lives in `src/debug_panel.cpp`.
- `F7` remains an external realtime/performance toggle and is not part of the panel system.
- The welcome system message is a lifecycle behavior rather than a user-controlled panel feature.
- The emoji/GIF picker is an in-world chat helper, not a panel module. Its ON/OFF controls live inside the picker.

## Asset Notes

- Interface assets used by the PNG redirect must exist in the client `Data/interface` tree.
- Custom interface assets for `ADVANCED/UI=1` must exist in `Data/interfep6`. Non-icon `.tga/.jpg` files should be converted to `.png`; the broad PNG redirect intentionally leaves `icon` assets alone.
- Raid button assets are expected as PNG.
- Battleground uses `main_stats_pvp_button.png`.
- Visual chat token assets are read from the internal data archive: `Data/Emojis/emojiN.png` and `Data/Gifs/gifN.gif`.
- Roulette item icons use embedded DDS atlas resources in `resources/item_icons_atlas`. These resources mirror the client item icon atlases needed to draw server-defined rewards inside the ImGui panel. DDS textures (DXT1/DXT3/DXT5) are decoded by a built-in parser; PNG textures are decoded by stb_image. Neither path requires the D3DX runtime.
- The client intentionally keeps icon assets outside the broad PNG redirect unless a feature explicitly handles them.
- Custom recreation rune UI acceptance is only client-side placement. Server behavior is implemented in `sdev`.
